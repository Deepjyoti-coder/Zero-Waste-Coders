🌱 EcoConnect – Smart Waste Segregation & Engagement Platform
📌 Problem Statement

India is among the world’s top waste producers, yet only ~30% of waste is effectively segregated at source.
Once waste is mixed (food + plastic, medical + dry), recycling becomes costly, inefficient, and often impossible.
Youth are not engaged in proper waste segregation, leading to higher environmental and economic costs.

💡 Our Solution

EcoConnect is an AI-powered waste segregation and gamification platform that helps students and institutions:

📸 Snap Waste Photo → AI model classifies into wet, dry, e-waste, or hazardous.

🏆 Gamified Rewards → Students earn ecoPoints for correct segregation, redeemable for perks.

📊 Impact Dashboard → Tracks CO₂ saved, waste reduced, participation stats.

📅 Scheduled Pickup → Users request waste collection at chosen time.

✨ Key Features

AI Waste Segregation – Machine Learning model trained on waste dataset.

Reward Marketplace – Redeem ecoPoints for campus perks / vouchers.

Leaderboard – Compete with peers, hostels, or departments.

Scheduled Pickup – Plan waste disposal with ease.

Impact Dashboard – Real-time stats on environmental benefits.
